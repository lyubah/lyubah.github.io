            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>"Aren't you too social to be a master's student in computer science?" they often ask. To which I reply in a (bad) British accent, "You mustn't have met the lot of us."</p>
            <p>I’m all about breaking coder stereotypes, blending high-energy social skills with a passion for machine learning, data science, and mathematics. I started with a strong foundation in mathematics and data science at UC Berkeley, which naturally evolved into a focus on cutting-edge machine learning and AI research during my master's in computer science at Washington State University.</p>
            <p>When I’m not TAing or building neural networks, you’ll find me outdoors—skiing, climbing, and chasing sunsets. I’ve also dabbled in debugging code in the wild, but the jury’s still out on whether that’s a good idea. Currently, I’m open to internships for Summer 2025 and am excited to apply my skills in a dynamic professional environment.</p>

        <h2>GANs for Activity Recognition Survey</h2>
        <p>This paper explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic datasets for human activity recognition tasks. By balancing data scarcity issues, it demonstrates how GANs can improve the accuracy of recognition models, particularly for underrepresented activity classes. This research highlights practical applications in wearable technology and health monitoring systems.</p>

        <h2>Context-Tree-Based Algorithm for Stock Prediction</h2>
        <p>This paper introduces a context-tree-based algorithm to analyze temporal dependencies in stock market data. By capturing hierarchical patterns, this method enhances prediction accuracy and provides a novel approach to measuring structural similarities between stocks. Applications include portfolio optimization and risk analysis.</p>
